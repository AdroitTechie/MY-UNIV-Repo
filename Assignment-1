/**
Samantha and Vikas are looking to buy a house in a new development.
After looking at various models the three models they like are colonial,
splitentry, and single-story. The builder gave them the base price and the
finished area in square feet of the three models. They want to know the
price per square foot of the three models and the model with the least price
per square foot. Write a program that accepts as input the base price and
the finished area in square feet of the three models. The program outputs
the price per square foot of the three models and the model with the least
price per square foot.
